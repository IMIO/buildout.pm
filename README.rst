Buildout for Products.PloneMeeting and various profiles.

The main config file is buildout.cfg.

It uses communes.cfg by default (will activate Products.MeetingCommunes).

Profile specific configuration files may be enabled (bep.cfg, liege.cfg, ...), this is made by commenting everything but the necessary .cfg
